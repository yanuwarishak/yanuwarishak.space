## What is Telkom Mystery Shopper

Telkom Mystery Shopper was my first internship project at Telkom Kotabaru Yogyakarta.
In conventional process of Mystery Shopper assessment, the assessor usually needs to fill the paper based form manually as the assessment goes.
This create a problem where the assessment result could be biased since the target that's being assessed is aware of the process.
This website try to solve that problem by transforming the paper and pen based form into digital form.
This also enable for the result to be generated right away after the assessment done.

The Development process of this website was done using jQuery as the front-end part, while the answer being calculated and processed using Node.js.
The result from the assessment is converted into a PDF form which then will be sent to the manager through e-mail using nodemailer.

### What it taught me

Some takeaways I learned by doing this project:

- JQuery
- Nodemailer for Node.js

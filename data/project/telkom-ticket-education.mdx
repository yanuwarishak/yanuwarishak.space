## What is Telkom Ticket Education

Telkom Ticket Education was my second internship project at Telkom Kotabaru Yogyakarta.
Ticket Education is a process where the service provider informing the user regarding their ticket report.
This process being done through WhatsApp chat service and in many cases each ticket have their own unique information.
This led to tedious copy-paste process where the operator need to select the correct template before adding additional information regarding the ticket.
This website is intended to make that process easier where the template is already built into several pre-built options that the operator only need
to add the additional information without copy and pasting the template.
There is no need for any back-end for this website since it's only utilizing WhatsApp API and deployed on Heroku.

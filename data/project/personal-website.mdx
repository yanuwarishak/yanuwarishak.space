## Personal Website

Having a personal website is one of my goal as a developer. This website is my second
attempt of making a personal website, the first one turns out wasn't really as good
as I hope. Back then I was still learning on utilizing React without paying attention
to stuff like SEO and such. You can take a look at my previous website [here](https://thirsty-brahmagupta-fa884b.netlify.app/).

This website however was developed with those thing in mind.
I was doing research about SEO and stuff and found that static website considerably have better SEO.
Considering that I use Next.js for my second trial of making a personal website.

I was doing a lot of research and trying to find inspiration until I ended up on [Lee's Personal Site](https://leerob.io).
This site is inspired by Lee's website, thought I tried my best to give my own personal touch.
I was planning to use a headless CMS for managing the content inside this website, but after reading through Lee's post I found that it is much
better to use Markdown file as CMS if it's a website for personal use.

## Why Next.js

My initial reason was mainly SEO, but in the process of developing this website
I discovered that Next.js give a much better Developer Experience compared to developing just in React.
You can create many type of websites (SSR, SSG, CSR, ISR) using Next.js.
The routing is easy to understand, development and build time is fast since the latest Next.js already uses SWC,
and the API creation alongside UseSWR hooks is super easy to integrate to the app.
I learned a lot by developing this website using Next.js, and that makes me sure that I have a lot more to learn.

## Other technology that I use

I use Tailwind CSS for styling. Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces [[1]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-tailwind-css/).
It gives an easier way of managing components style eliminating the needs of switching between css file and component file.
At first I do struggling a bit memorizing the predefined utility classes name, but as the time goes it's alreay becoming my second nature on writing css.
Personally I think adopting Tailwind is not hard, the docs is written really concise
and they also provide free learning material uploaded on [Tailwind Labs on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/tailwindlabs).

I use Markdown files as content management system for this website, MDX to be precise.
Practically by using MDX you can put React component inside your Markdown file,
this enable me to use Next.js Image components that give a much better responsive advantage
and helps avoiding CLS (Content Layout Shift).

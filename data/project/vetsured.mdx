## What is Vetsured

Vetsured is an Android application that was developed for my final thesis.
It's a Virtual Reality education app that simulates surgery process on animal specifically dog.
This application was developed using Unity3D with 360 video as the assets.
While using this application, users is advised to use Head-mounted Display for immersive effect.

## The Problem

The medical intern is a process that must be taken by a trainee doctor in order to obtain
the veterinary profession (drh). One of the stages that must be done in medical intern is the
surgical stage. As one of the animal health facilities under the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine
UGM, Prof. Soeparwi Vet Hospital is one of the places used by the trainee doctor to undergo
the medical intern process, especially surgical stage. The large number of trainee doctor in
Prof. Soeparwi Vet Hospital sometimes causes the available learning resources insufficient. In
dealing with these problems, Prof. Soeparwi Vet Hospital trying to provide alternative utilizing
information technology by developing an educational application.

## The Aims

This final project aims to develop and produce an educational application desired by Prof. Soeparwi Vet Hospital.
The application that will be developed contains information of medical procedures needed by
patients who must undergo the surgical process. Each of these procedures will be explained
using text and image as the medium. In addition, procedure accompanying material is provided
which given in conventional videos format that is uploaded on YouTube, as well as 360 videos
that can be played using a 360 video player that has been developed in the application.
Application development is carried out using Unity, with the target operating system is
Android, and Rapid Application Development (RAD) as the development method. Each feature
that has been developed, will be tested using Black Box Testing.

## User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ)

The application will be tested to the user using User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) 
in order to find out how the user experience aspect of the application. 
The test results for each feature using Black Box Testing shows that all features which
have been developed provide valid outputs and meet the desired requirements. In addition,
based on the results of user experience testing using UEQ, it was found that the attractiveness
scale of the application valued at 2.25, with pragmatic and hedonic qualities valued at 1.81
and 2.04, respectively.

## What it taught me

## What is Kitabatik

Kitabatik is an idea that me and my two other friends submit on several UI/UX competitions.
Since the competition itself was about UI/UX, most of the works I've done on this project was UI Design and UX Research.
We won 3rd place in one competition and qualified for another ideation competition.
Kitabatik itself was an idea of making a Batik e-commerce where the users could learn the philospy behind the batik's motif.
The idea was to use image recognition or pattern recognition to be able to determine what's the name of the scanned batik's motif.

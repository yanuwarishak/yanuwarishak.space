Dev Connector is a social network application developed with Node.js, Express, React, Redux & MongoDB
This project helps me to understand how to integrate a React frontend and a Node.js backend manually.
Before taking this course my understanding between Node.js and React is somehow doesn't intertwined with each other.
Developing this project taught me how to integrate a backend and frontend fully using JavaScript.

### What it taught me

Some takeaways I learned by doing this project:

- API creation using Node.js and Express.js
- Database management using MongoDB
- JWT Authentication
- Axios
- Redux Thunk for Async request

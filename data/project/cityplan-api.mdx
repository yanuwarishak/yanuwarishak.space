## What is Cityplan API

Cityplan API was a team project and also my first project developing an API.
There was a lot of consideration before picking the language and database we are going to use,
since we are working with a heavy computation server and a big dataset.
In the end we decided to develop the API using Go and PostgreSQL.
As a JavaScript developer going back to statically typed language was somehow a weird experience.
But as the concept take shape, I found that the main difference was just the nature of writing code where JavaScript tends to be implicit and Go is more explicit.

### What it taught me

Some takeaways I learned by doing this project:
- Creating API using Go
- CORS for API
- PostgreSQL

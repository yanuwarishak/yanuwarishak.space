## What is Crown Clothing

Crown Clothing is an clothing e-commerce website.
This project was the final product from one of online course that I've taken, and it's my first projects using React.js.

The course started by developing react in old approach of declaring a react component as a class components.
As the project progress, the application starting to adapt the functional approach and utilizing react hooks for basic state management.
The course walk me through several options for global state management which are redux, hooks and apollo client.
Although the final application uses redux, the explanation for hooks and apollo client was quite thorough.

The data for this project is stored on firebase.
Using firebase also enable the website to handle sign in and sign up using both google and the conventional e-mail password combination.
This website use Stripe API for handling payment since it is easier to set up rather than making one from scratch.

### What it taught me

- React (Class components, functional components, lifecycle, state, conditional rendering, hooks, and a lot other concepts)
- Redux (Thunk, Saga)
- GraphQL (Consuming GraphQL from client side)
- Apollo Client (State management with Apollo Client)
- Working with Firebase
- SCSS and Styled Components

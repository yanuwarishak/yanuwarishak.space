_Read detailed instructions for gap property usage from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gap)_

I'm by no means is the right person you want to ask regarding CSS.
I'll always try cutting corners to find a better way to write _less_ CSS.
Recently I discoverd [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework.
I fall in love with tailwindcss, mostly because I don't have to write CSS by myself.
But unexpectedly my tailwindcss discoveries led me to one powerful CSS property I never knew it existed.
And you're right, it's the **gap** property.

### Why does it such a big fuss for me

If you haven't already know, I'm not a big fan of CSS.
I hate going back and forth between files just to make my website look much better.
I'm not a person with a good memory. I can't remember all the available css properties and the right value for it.
That's why tailwindcss is like a revelation for me.
I don't have to remember all of them since the tailwind auto-complete will just show me what's available and what's not.

One day, on a sunny day, I scrolled down on the properties that I can access, and I stumbled upon this Gap property.
Never seen it before, never heard about it, never used it too.
And like most people do I googled about this property, read the docs a bit, and tried it out.
I'm an outdated person if it's about CSS, I manually set gutters and distance of my elements all using margin and padding.
Imagine all that elements that I have to manually set in each one of them, if you can't imagine it, it's a lot.

Even though I use reusable components, it's still quite a hassle to write each of the gutters from that component.
Gap property changed this all. I deleted all the my-4 mx-4 and then add this little magic to my Container component:

```html
<main className="flex flex-col justify-start gap-8">{children}</main>
```

That 5 characters of **gap-8** automatically made my components having a proper distance between them.
I don't have to add first child or last child selector anymore.
I don't have to add new margin to every new components I add to the page.
Just one Container component and put **gap** on it,
then the children will align themselves like an obidient child they should be.
And just like that each pages having a consistent layout gutters.
I'm a happy man.

### So what's the cons?

Don't quote me on this, but as far as I know gap property was once only applicable to grid layout.
But at this moment, gap property is already supported on both grid and flex layout.
However, for some older browsers this property might not be supported.
You can check whether you can use this gap property in this [can i use website](https://caniuse.com/?search=gap).

So, that's pretty much my discovery and my first impression of gap property.
The takeaways is I need to learn more about CSS.
If you have never tried to use gap property before, then give it a shot.
See you then.
